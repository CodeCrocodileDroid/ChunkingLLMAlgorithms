Chunking LLM Algorithms
A collection of text chunking strategies designed for effective preprocessing of documents before feeding them into Large Language Models (LLMs).

📌 Purpose
Text chunking is essential for handling long documents in LLMs due to context window limitations. This repo explores various chunking techniques—such as fixed-size, sliding window, paragraph-based, and semantic chunking—to help optimize retrieval, summarization, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.

📂 Contents
Example implementations of different chunking algorithms in Python
Utilities to split text while preserving meaning and context
Demo scripts showing chunking impact on downstream LLM tasks
🚀 Use Case
Ideal for developers and researchers building:

RAG systems
Document Q&A applications
LLM-based summarization tools
